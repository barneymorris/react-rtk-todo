## What is it? 

This is simple TODO list generator application.
Was written using React and Redux Toolkit (tha last one is new technology, so this is was some kinda practicing)
As as as I was write Unit and Integration tests for all this stuff. 

## How to run?
Make sure you have Node.js >= 12 and NPM >=8

Close this repo, and in terminal just type:
1) npm install (for installing deps)
2) npm run start (for local developing)
3) npm run build (for production ready build)
4) npm run  test (if you want to see some passed tests :))
